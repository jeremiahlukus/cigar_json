The Damaso Red Label offers a more robust flavor profile.\nHand-crafted with a luxurious Connecticut-seed wrapper, the blend utilizes the finest aged Nicaraguan tobaccos for the binder and filler. This is a mild to medium-bodied cigar, with warm notes of fresh cocoa, sweet caramel and smoked cedar. The burn and draw are exceptionally smooth with hints of subtle spices for a toasty finish.

Having earned countless 90 + cigar ratings, this new line of cigars is no different from his collection of premium boutique smokes. The Sixty cigar blend utilizes a vintage Mexican San Andres wrapper covering a never before used selection of perfectly aged Nicaraguan binder and long-fillers. Each batch of long-filler tobaccos is aged for no less than 6 years before being hand-rolled with an additional 2 years of aging to cement the quality and flavor. Smokers are treated to a medium to full-bodied profile ranging with strong hints of freshly roasted dark coffee, aged oak, and subtle earthy spices for a toasty finish. You can never go wrong with Rocky Patel, as the box-pressed style noticeably delivers a smoother smoke, so stock up while you can today!",

Blond Connecticut-seed wrappers grown in Ecuador license a tremendous mild – to medium-bodied white pepper to mingle with overt cream. Nicaraguan hand-rolled binder and filler tobaccos gently highlight dry earth. Filled with versatile appeal, San Cristobal Elegancia politely entices a traditionally mild audience with a touch of backbone, but remains civil to those exclusively prospecting for potency.",

This limited edition humidor is designed to look just like the Hemingway House that sits at Chateau de la Fuente, the farm owned by Arturo Fuente in Caribe, Dominican Republic, that produces all of the tobacco used for the Fuente Fuente OpusX line. The home was built to replicate Ernest Hemingways historic house in Key West! It aims to replicate the home by including Spanish tile on the base of the humidor and gold inlays for the railings. The lid uses metal to replicate the look of stained glass, which is used throughout the building. The incredible artistry goes further with animals you’ll see throughout including a blue-eyed white horse. Each humidor is handmade in France. Elie Bleu has said “this is one of the most intensive humidors it’s ever made”. Holding up to 110 cigars and measures at 14.45 inches x 12.6 inches x 9.84 inches. This Rare humidor also has a built in hygrometer, made to use the 320g Boveda packs, which are stored inside of the magnetically attached cover.\nAlthough Arturo Fuente has declined to talk details about the cigar’s blend. Each humidor comes with 60 cigars, though the cigars are packaged in their own box. Elie Bleu says “the cigars will only be sold in the humidors”. Included in this Package is the Elie Bleu Limoges Porcelain Ashtray Hemingway OpusX which can hold four cigars. Also included, is the J-14 Elie Bleu Hemingway OpusX torch lighter and the Elie Bleu stainless steel Cutter.\n ",

The result of decades of efforts by the temperance movement, which believed that poverty and other societal problems were caused by alcohol consumption, the 18th Amendment was ratified on January 16, 1919 and the ban of alcohol sales began. Luckily, the ban only lasted until 1933 when the 21st Amendment was ratified on December 5 of that year, repealing the 18th Amendment.\n ",
